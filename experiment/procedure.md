#### Piping Diagram Configuration:
- Configure all parameters for the piping diagram. In which you need to identify vessels and equipment to run the plant
- Click on the "Verify Components" button
- If all configuration parameters are correct, the "Next Level" button will be visible.
- Click on the "Next Level" button to proceed
#### Instrument Diagram Configuration:
- Follow the same steps as above to configure the instrument diagram. In this you will have identify the instruments required to run the plant
- Click on the "Verify Instruments" button
- If all configuration parameters are correct, the "Next Level" button will be visible
- Click on the "Next Level" button to continue
#### Sequence of Activities:
- Read the “Prior Knowledge Assessment” statements carefully
- Enter the appropriate sequence number in the provided text box. The system will not allow you to write the duplicate numbers. Hence be careful
- Click on the "Submit" button
- You have three attempts to verify whether the sequence is correct or otherwise
- Try for three times and then proceed to the Simulation section
#### Simulation Execution:
- Click on the "Start" button to begin the simulation
- The first time setting runs for 5 minutes by default
- For other test cycles, you can choose different time durations such as 2 min, 3 min, 4 min, etc
- The simulation will display the status and phases during execution
- You can start the next test cycle or view the datasheet and trends according to the test cycles
- The datasheet for each test cycle can be downloaded in PDF format by clicking on the "Download " button
- Multiple readings are available in line  format
- Use the checkbox to view different series or hide specific series as needed
- Click on the "Download Graph"button to save the graph 

#### Data Monitoring & Graphs:
- View the Datasheet and Trends according
- The trend functionality allows you to see multiple readings in a line or trend format
- Use the checkbox to switch between different series or hide/show specific data
 Download the graph using "Download Graph" button
 
#### Result Assessment:
- Click on the "Result" button to view your performance assessment.
